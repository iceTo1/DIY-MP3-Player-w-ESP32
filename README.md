# DIY-MP3-Player-w-ESP32
As my first embedded project, I attempted to build a basic MP3 player using an MCU, an SD Card module, an LCD Screen, a DAC module, and Input buttons.

## âœ… Features
- Play, pause, stop, next, previous functionality using buttons
- WAV playback via PCM5102 (I2S)
- SD card file navigation
- LCD display for basic UI

## ðŸ“¦ Hardware Used
- ESP32-WROOM-32
- PCM5102A (I2S DAC)
- ST7796 3.5" LCD (SPI)
- MicroSD card & Module w/ level shifter (SPI)
- 4 push buttons

## ðŸ§° Libraries Required
- `SPI.h`, `Wire.h`, `SD.h`, `FS.h`
- `I2S` for audio

## ðŸ“– How to Use
1. Insert `.wav` files into your SD card (16-bit PCM, 44.1kHz).
2. Connect all components as shown in the diagram.
3. Flash `src/main.ino` to your ESP32 board.
4. Use the buttons or touchscreen to control playback.

## ðŸ’¬ Notes & Acknowledgements

All planning, system design, and implementation logic were fully developed by me.

However, I received support from Chat4o during development â€” especially in:

- Recommending minimal required libraries for hardware modules
- Suggesting reliable initialization sequences for SPI (ST7796), I2S (PCM5102), and SD card
- Providing debugging tips

All code was written and tested by me, but I referred to ChatGPT for architectural validation and quick technical feedback when needed.
